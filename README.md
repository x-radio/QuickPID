QuickPID is an updated implementation of the Arduino PID library with a built-in [AutoTune](https://github.com/Dlloydev/QuickPID/wiki/AutoTune) class as a dynamic object  to reduce memory if not used, thanks to contributions by [gnalbandian (Gonzalo)](https://github.com/gnalbandian). This controller can automatically determine and set parameters `Kp, Ki, Kd`. Additionally the Ultimate Gain `Ku`, Ultimate Period `Tu`, Dead Time `td` and determine how easy the process is to control. There are 10 tuning rules available to choose from. Also available are POn and DOn settings where POn controls the mix of Proportional on Error to Proportional on Measurement and DOn controls the mix of Derivative on Error to Derivative on Measurement.

### [AutoTune](https://github.com/Dlloydev/QuickPID/wiki/AutoTune)

#### [AutoTune Filter Examples](https://github.com/Dlloydev/QuickPID/wiki/AutoTune-Filter-Examples)

The examples [AutoTune_Filter_DIRECT.ino](https://github.com/Dlloydev/QuickPID/blob/master/examples/AutoTune_Filter_DIRECT/AutoTune_Filter_DIRECT.ino) and [AutoTune_Filter_REVERSE.ino](https://github.com/Dlloydev/QuickPID/blob/master/examples/AutoTune_Filter_REVERSE/AutoTune_Filter_REVERSE.ino) allow you to experiment with the AutoTunePID class, various tuning rules and the POn and DOn controls using ADC and PWM with RC filter. It automatically determines and sets the tuning parameters and works with both `DIRECT` and `REVERSE` acting controllers.

#### Direct and Reverse Controller Action

If a positive error increases the controller's output, the controller is said to be direct acting (i.e. heating process). When a positive error decreases the controller's output, the controller is said to be reverse acting (i.e. cooling process). When the controller is set to `REVERSE` acting, the sign of the `error` and `dInput` (derivative of Input) is internally changed. All operating ranges and limits remain the same. To simulate a `REVERSE` acting process from a process that's  `DIRECT` acting, the Input value needs to be "flipped". That is, if your reading from a 10-bit ADC with 0-1023 range, the input value used is (1023 - reading). 

### Functions

#### QuickPID_Constructor

```c++
QuickPID::QuickPID(float* Input, float* Output, float* Setpoint,
                   float Kp, float Ki, float Kd, float POn, float DOn, uint8_t ControllerDirection);
```

- `Input`, `Output`, and `Setpoint` are pointers to the variables holding these values.
- `Kp`, `Ki`, and `Kd` are the PID proportional, integral, and derivative gains.
- `POn` controls the mix of Proportional on Error to Proportional on Measurement. Range is 0.0-1.0, default = 1.0 
- `DOn` controls the mix of Derivative on Error to Derivative on Measurement. Range is 0.0-1.0, default = 0.0 

![POnDOn](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63488701/120000053-68de3e00-bfa0-11eb-9db2-04c2f4be76a2.png)

- `ControllerDirection` Either DIRECT or REVERSE determines which direction the output will move for a given error. 

```c++
QuickPID::QuickPID(float* Input, float* Output, float* Setpoint,
                   float Kp, float Ki, float Kd, uint8_t ControllerDirection);
```

This allows you to use Proportional on Error without explicitly saying so.

#### Compute

```c++
bool QuickPID::Compute();
```

This function contains the PID algorithm and it should be called once every loop(). Most of the time it will just return false without doing anything. However, at a  frequency specified by `SetSampleTime` it will calculate a new Output and return true.

#### SetTunings

```c++
void QuickPID::SetTunings(float Kp, float Ki, float Kd, float POn, float DOn);
```

This function allows the controller's dynamic performance to be adjusted. It's called automatically from the constructor, but tunings can also be adjusted on the fly during normal operation. The parameters are as described in the constructor.

```c++
void QuickPID::SetTunings(float Kp, float Ki, float Kd);
```

Set Tunings using the last remembered POn and DOn settings. See example [PID_AdaptiveTunings.ino](https://github.com/Dlloydev/QuickPID/blob/master/examples/PID_AdaptiveTunings/PID_AdaptiveTunings.ino)

#### SetSampleTime

```c++
void QuickPID::SetSampleTimeUs(uint32_t NewSampleTimeUs);
```

Sets the period, in microseconds, at which the calculation is performed. The default is 100ms.

#### SetOutputLimits

```c++
void QuickPID::SetOutputLimits(int Min, int Max);
```

The PID controller is designed to vary its output within a given range.  By default this range is 0-255, the Arduino PWM range.

#### SetMode

```c++
void QuickPID::SetMode(uint8_t Mode);
```

Allows the controller Mode to be set to `MANUAL` (0) or `AUTOMATIC` (1) or `TIMER` (2). when the transition from manual to automatic  or timer occurs, the controller is automatically initialized. 

`TIMER` mode is used when the PID compute is called by an external timer function or ISR. In this mode, the timer function and SetSampleTimeUs use the same time period value. The PID compute and timer will always remain in sync because the sample time variable and calculations remain constant. See examples:

- [AutoTune_AVR_Interrupt_TIMER.ino](https://github.com/Dlloydev/QuickPID/blob/master/examples/AutoTune_AVR_Interrupt_TIMER/AutoTune_AVR_Interrupt_TIMER.ino)
- [AutoTune_AVR_Software_TIMER.ino](https://github.com/Dlloydev/QuickPID/blob/master/examples/AutoTune_AVR_Software_TIMER/AutoTune_AVR_Software_TIMER.ino)
- [PID_AVR_Basic_Interrupt_TIMER.ino](https://github.com/Dlloydev/QuickPID/blob/master/examples/PID_AVR_Basic_Interrupt_TIMER/PID_AVR_Basic_Interrupt_TIMER.ino)
- [PID_AVR_Basic_Software_TIMER.ino](https://github.com/Dlloydev/QuickPID/blob/master/examples/PID_AVR_Basic_Software_TIMER/PID_AVR_Basic_Software_TIMER.ino)

#### Initialize

```c++
void QuickPID::Initialize();
```

Does all the things that need to happen to ensure a bump-less transfer from manual to automatic mode.

#### SetControllerDirection

```c++
void QuickPID::SetControllerDirection(uint8_t Direction)
```

The PID will either be connected to a DIRECT acting process (+Output leads to +Input) or a REVERSE acting process (+Output leads to -Input.) We need to know which one, because otherwise we may increase the output when we should be decreasing. This is called from the constructor.

#### PID Query Functions

```c++
    float GetKp();               // proportional gain
    float GetKi();               // integral gain
    float GetKd();               // derivative gain
    float GetPterm();            // proportional component of output 
    float GetIterm();            // integral component of output
    float GetDterm();            // derivative component of output
    mode_t GetMode();            // MANUAL (0) or AUTOMATIC (1) or TIMER (2)
    direction_t GetDirection();  // DIRECT (0) or REVERSE (1)
```

These functions query the internal state of the PID.

#### Utility Functions

```c++
int QuickPID::analogReadFast(int ADCpin)
```

A faster configuration of `analogRead()`where a preset of 32 is used.  If the architecture definition isn't found, normal `analogRead()`is used to return a value.

#### [AnalogWrite (PWM and DAC) for ESP32](https://github.com/Dlloydev/ESP32-ESP32S2-AnalogWrite)

Use this link for reference. Note that if you're using QuickPID, there's no need to install the AnalogWrite library as this feature is already included.
